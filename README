# Breedle - Dog Breed Guessing Game

Breedle is a terminal-based game that tests your knowledge about different dog breeds. Guess the correct breed name within five attempts, and win!

## Game Concept

At the beginning of each game, Breedle selects a random dog breed from a predefined list. The length of the breed's name is displayed as underscores, which provides players with their first clue.

The player then has five attempts to guess the breed. They input their guess in the terminal. If a breed's name consists of two words (e.g., "German Shepherd"), the player inputs them without spaces ("germanshepherd").

After each guess, Breedle gives feedback:
- If a letter is correct and in the right place, the terminal will display the letter in the underscored spot (b____r).
- If a letter is incorrect (i.e., not in the breed name), it will be not shown at all.

The game continues until the player guesses the breed correctly or exhausts all five attempts. After every game, the correct answer is revealed, regardless of whether the player was successful or not.
